### Overview
Heart disease is a leading cause of mortality worldwide, emphasizing the critical need for early detection and treatment. This project aims to develop an AI-based Heart Disease Prediction System utilizing machine learning algorithms. By analyzing patient data, including medical history and clinical attributes, the system predicts the risk of heart disease accurately.

### Key Features
- Utilizes UCI Heart Disease dataset and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm.
- Provides insights into the relationship between various attributes and heart disease risk.
- Analyzes factors like age, sex, cholesterol level, and chest pain type.
- Evaluates different machine learning algorithms for prediction accuracy.

### Findings
- Age and cholesterol level significantly impact heart disease risk.
- Males tend to have higher risk factors compared to females.
- SVM algorithm achieves the highest prediction accuracy.

### Technologies Used
- Python
- Streamlit
- Machine Learning (SVM, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees)

### Project Details
This project was developed as a final project deliverable for the IBM SkillsBuild Data Analytics Internship, under the guidance of CSRBOX Foundation.
